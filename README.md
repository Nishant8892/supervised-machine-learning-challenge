-Analysis:
The dataset does not contain any null values and consists of integers or floats, so minimal data cleansing was required before testing.
The data presents a positive trend which is shown with the use of a histogram.
Logistic Regression Model
After testing the two models head to head, it's clear that logistic regression presents a higher level of accuracy.
Comparing traditional classification report with the use of GaussianNB Classification Report, interestingly presents slightly different data
Random Forest Classifier
When we compare both training and testing scores, it becomes clear that there is not a significant difference between the two models.
The bar chart provides a visual representation of the features. Interestingly, Feature 5 performed the worst while Feature 1 performed significantly better.
Overall
Both models show signs of positive trends
Although there wasn't a significant difference between both training models, it is clear Logistic Regression Model peformed better than the Random Forest Classifier
